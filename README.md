## About

Automatically change your Discord status to Idle upon app minimization or window focus loss.

### Note
After installing this plugin, make sure to activate it and then restart the Discord client at least twice by pressing `CTRL+R`. I don't know what's causing this bug, but it's probably has something to do with the initial config file being not created after activating the plugin for the first time.

## Requirements

Before starting, you need to have [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app) installed.

## Starting
Add the the `.js` file into your BD plugins folder.

## License ##

This project is under license from MIT. For more details, see the [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) file.
